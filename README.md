this has been fun and a lot of work.

Simple Calculator Project
This project is a simple calculator web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for each digit, operator buttons (+, -, *, /), an equals button (=) to perform calculations, a clear button (C) to reset the calculator, and a backspace button (‚Üê) to delete the last digit entered. It also supports keyboard input for enhanced usability.

Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

Create a functional calculator: Implement a calculator that can perform basic math operations, allowing users to input numbers and operators to get the desired result.

Handle multiple operations: Enable users to chain multiple operations together to get accurate results, following the correct order of operations.

Error handling: Implement error handling to avoid issues like dividing by zero and displaying appropriate error messages.

Support decimal numbers: Allow users to input decimal numbers and prevent entering multiple decimal points.

Keyboard support: Provide keyboard support so that users can use the calculator efficiently without relying solely on mouse clicks.

User interface: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the calculator.

Skills Acquired
During the implementation of this calculator project, the following skills were acquired:

JavaScript Programming: Practiced JavaScript programming by creating functions for basic arithmetic operations, handling user input, and implementing calculator logic.

DOM Manipulation: Gained experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to update and display the calculator's state and results on the web page.

Event Handling: Learned how to handle user interactions by adding event listeners to buttons and keyboard inputs.

Error Handling: Implemented error handling to prevent issues like dividing by zero and displaying relevant error messages to the user.

CSS Styling: Developed CSS skills by styling the calculator interface to create an attractive and user-friendly design.

Git Version Control: Utilized version control with Git to manage project changes and collaborate with others effectively.

Problem Solving: Improved problem-solving skills by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps and implementing solutions
